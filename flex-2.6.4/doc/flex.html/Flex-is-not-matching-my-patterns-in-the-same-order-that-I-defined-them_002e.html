<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Flex is not matching my patterns in the same order that I defined them.</h3>

<p><code>flex</code> picks the
rule that matches the most text (i.e., the longest possible input string).
This is because <code>flex</code> uses an entirely different matching technique
(&ldquo;deterministic finite automata&rdquo;) that actually does all of the matching
simultaneously, in parallel.  (Seems impossible, but it&rsquo;s actually a fairly
simple technique once you understand the principles.)
</p>
<p>A side-effect of this parallel matching is that when the input matches more
than one rule, <code>flex</code> scanners pick the rule that matched the <em>most</em> text. This
is explained further in the manual, in the section See <a href="Matching.html#Matching">Matching</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want <code>flex</code> to choose a shorter match, then you can work around this
behavior by expanding your short
rule to match more text, then put back the extra:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="verbatim">data_.*        yyless( 5 ); BEGIN BLOCKIDSTATE;
</pre></div>

<p>Another fix would be to make the second rule active only during the
<code>&lt;BLOCKIDSTATE&gt;</code> start condition, and make that start condition exclusive
by declaring it with <code>%x</code> instead of <code>%s</code>.
</p>
<p>A final fix is to change the input language so that the ambiguity for
&lsquo;<samp>data_</samp>&rsquo; is removed, by adding characters to it that don&rsquo;t match the
identifier rule, or by removing characters (such as &lsquo;<samp>_</samp>&rsquo;) from the
identifier rule so it no longer matches &lsquo;<samp>data_</samp>&rsquo;.  (Of course, you might
also not have the option of changing the input language.)
