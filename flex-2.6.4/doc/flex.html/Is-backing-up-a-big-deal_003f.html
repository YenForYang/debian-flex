&gt; a lot about the backing up problem.
&gt; I believe that there lies my biggest problem, and I'll try to improve
&gt; it.

Since you have variable trailing context, this is a bigger performance
problem.  Fixing it is usually easier than fixing backing up, which in a
complicated scanner (yours seems to fit the bill) can be extremely
difficult to do correctly.

You also don't mention what flags you are using for your scanner.
-f makes a large speed difference, and -Cfe buys you nearly as much
speed but the resulting scanner is considerably smaller.

&gt; I have an | operator in {and} and in {pats} so both of them are variable
&gt; length.

-p should have reported this.

&gt; Is changing one of them to fixed-length is enough ?

Yes.

&gt; Is it possible to change the 32,000 states limit ?

Yes.  I've appended instructions on how.  Before you make this change,
though, you should think about whether there are ways to fundamentally
simplify your scanner - those are certainly preferable!

		Vern

To increase the 32K limit (on a machine with 32 bit integers), you increase
the magnitude of the following in flexdef.h:

#define JAMSTATE -32766 /* marks a reference to the state that always jams */
#define MAXIMUM_MNS 31999
#define BAD_SUBSCRIPT -32767
#define MAX_SHORT 32700

Adding a 0 or two after each should do the trick.
