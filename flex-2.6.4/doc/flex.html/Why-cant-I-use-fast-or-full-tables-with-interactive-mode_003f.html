<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Why can&rsquo;t I use fast or full tables with interactive mode?</h3>

<p>One of the assumptions
flex makes is that interactive applications are inherently slow (they&rsquo;re
waiting on a human after all).
It has to do with how the scanner detects that it must be finished scanning
a token.  For interactive scanners, after scanning each character the current
state is looked up in a table (essentially) to see whether there&rsquo;s a chance
of another input character possibly extending the length of the match.  If
not, the scanner halts.  For non-interactive scanners, the end-of-token test
is much simpler, basically a compare with 0, so no memory bus cycles.  Since
the test occurs in the innermost scanning loop, one would like to make it go
as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>Still, it seems reasonable to allow the user to choose to trade off a bit
of performance in this area to gain the corresponding flexibility.  There
might be another reason, though, why fast scanners don&rsquo;t support the
interactive option.
